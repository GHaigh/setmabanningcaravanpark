8. **campervan-spots.jpg** - Hardstanding pitches for motorhomes and caravans
9. **holiday-homes.jpg** - Luxury static caravans with mountain views
10. **about-farm.jpg** - Working farm experience

## How to Replace Images

### Step 1: Prepare Your Photos
- **Recommended size**: 800x600 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for web performance
- **Quality**: High resolution but optimized for web

### Step 2: Replace the Files
1. Navigate to the `nextjs/public/images/gallery/` directory
2. Replace the placeholder files with your actual photos
3. Keep the same filenames (e.g., `lake-district-view.jpg`)
4. For additional images, replace files in `nextjs/public/images/`

### Step 3: Update Image Information (Optional)
If you want to change captions or alt text, edit the `nextjs/data/site.ts` file:

```typescript
gallery: [
  {
    src: '/images/gallery/lake-district-view.jpg',
    alt: 'Your custom alt text',
    caption: 'Your custom caption'
  },
  // ... more images
]
```

### Step 4: Deploy Changes
After replacing images, run:
```bash
cd nextjs
vercel --prod
```
